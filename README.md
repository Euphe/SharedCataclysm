SharedCataclysm 

Public world for Cataclysm:Dark Days Ahead.
===============


The world is created with all defaults except for item spawn being 1.2

To play (for win):

1. Navigate to your cataclysm/save folder
2. Open console command window, type: "git clone https://github.com/Euphe/SharedCataclysm". The whole world will be downloaded to you as "SharedCataclysm".
3. After you made some changes (played for a bit) go to save/ShareCataclysm, open console command window and type: 
git add *" - adds all changed files for commit
git commit -m "(your username)"
git push -u origin master

Then input your username and password when it asks for it.

4. Next time you load up the game open console command window in save/SharedCataclysm, type: "git pull origin" to get all the changes.

Happy clusterfuck.
